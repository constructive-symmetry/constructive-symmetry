0.000000	7.254914	The Stern-Brocot tree is an idea in math.  It is like a Museum of Fractions that you can visit in your mind.
7.254914	15.609852	An example of a fraction is one half, which is written as one over two, and is halfway between zero and one.
15.609852	24.183352	All the positive fractions,  which are the all the fractions bounded between zero and infinity, can be found somewhere inside this museum.
24.183352	29.217280	These boundaries also appear as fractions guarding the sides of the front door of the museum.
29.217280	35.378399	To the left of the front door, zero is written as the lower boundary fraction zero over one.
35.378399	41.616371	To the right of the front door, infinity is written as the upper boundary fraction one over zero.
41.616371	48.200186	On the front door is written the symbol of the mediant.   It looks like a fraction of plus signs, plus over plus.
48.200186	58.088718	To open the front door, first, we add across the top:  zero plus one equals one.  Then we add across the bottom:  one plus zero equals one.
58.088718	65.940622	As the door opens, we see the fraction one over one,  also known as one itself, sitting in the middle of its room.
65.940622	75.368030	When the door fully opens, we see two more doors with the symbol of the mediant, a door to the left and the other to the right of one over one.
75.368030	78.903308	The boundary fractions get copied into the front room:
78.903308	82.861282	zero over one is repeated to the left of the left door,
82.861282	87.203526	and one over zero is repeated to the right of the right door.
87.203526	92.327118	All the fractions between zero and one can be found somewhere behind the left door. 
92.327118	97.860596	All the fractions between one and infinity can be found somewhere behind the right door.
97.860596	102.945761	Both doors lead to a new and different room, deeper inside the museum.
102.945761	108.863509	However the fraction we've just seen will never again appear in the middle of another room.
108.863509	114.345752	To open the left door, we take the mediant of its boundary fractions, zero and one. 
114.345752	117.804176	Adding across the top, zero plus one is one. 
117.804176	121.608443	 Adding across the bottom, one plus one is two.
121.608443	129.383493	As the door opens, we see the fraction one over two, also known as one half, sitting in the middle of its room.
129.383493	135.045061	To open the right door, we take the mediant of its boundary fractions, one and infinity.
135.045061	138.516294	Adding across the top, one plus one is two.
138.516294	142.154044	Adding across the bottom, one plus zero is one.
142.154044	149.416735	As the door opens, we see the fraction two over one, also known as two, sitting in the middle of its room.
149.416735	154.476282	The boundary fractions get copied into the rooms we have just opened, same as before. 
154.476282	160.867962	The middle fraction is to the right of the left door, so it becomes an upper boundary fraction in the left room.
160.867962	166.593575	It's also to the left of the right door, so it becomes a lower boundary fraction in the right room.
166.593575	175.290872	The two rooms we just opened each have two doors, for a total of four unopened doors. I'm going to open all four doors.
175.290872	184.590190	The leftmost unopened door leads to all the fractions between zero and one half.  We open the door to find one over three, or one third.
184.590190	192.813554	The next door leads to all the fractions between one half and one.   We open the door to find two over three, or two thirds.
192.813554	200.550177	The next door leads to all the fractions between one and two, so we open the door to find three over two, or three halves
200.550177	208.952867	The rightmost door leads to all the fractions between two and infinity, so we open the door to find three over one, or just three.
208.952867	215.459829	In this garden of forking paths, the paths downward into the museum never ever come back together.
215.459829	222.760946	No two doors lead to the same room, so behind each unopened door is a unique room we have not seen before.
222.760946	234.788577	That room has two unseen doors, therefore every time we open a door, the number of unopened doors increases by two, in addition to decreasing by one for door we opened. 
234.788577	241.935987	Two minus one is one, so the net effect is that the number of unopened doors increases by one.
241.935987	248.314859	I had four unopened doors, and then I opened all four doors, so now I have eight unopened doors.
248.314859	252.951709	After I open those eight doors, I will have sixteen unopened doors.
252.951709	257.947210	And if I open those sixteen doors, I will have thirty-two unopened doors!
257.947210	263.813723	We can explore this museum as long as we want and we will never run out of new rooms to explore.
263.813723	267.886978	In fact, the more we explore, the more unopened doors we will have!
267.886978	277.519330	Exploring one entire level of the museum before going deeper, like I am doing right now, is an example of a breadth-first search.
277.519330	283.115252	Breadth-first search is a very important idea in computer science, math, and learning.
283.115252	289.482916	A breadth-first search is a good way to learn what the museum looks like, because it doesn't skip any rooms.
289.482916	295.451900	Because of this fact, and the fact that the the Stern-Brocot tree contains every fraction exactly once,
295.451900	301.241558	we can find any fraction we want by exploring the museum long enough with a breadth-first search.
301.241558	308.824473	But if we are looking for a specific fraction, a breadth-first search is very inefficient because it creates a lot of unnecessary work.
308.824473	316.138400	It is a lot less work to walk directly to the room containing that fraction, only moving down and left, or down and right.
316.138400	319.353454	That would be an example of a depth-first search.
319.353454	324.938168	Depth-first search is another very important idea in computer science, math, and learning.
324.938168	332.111196	These searches can skip rooms entirely,  which can make depth-first search efficient for finding something specific.
332.111196	346.201179	In my next video, I will show you how to efficiently find the room of any specific fraction, using the Euclidean Algorithm as a guidebook to the museum of fractions that is the Stern-Brocot tree.
