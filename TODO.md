* Fill in outlined sections in the Tools of Math Construction.

* Write the sequel to Kevin Bacon and the Stern-Brocot Tree

* Add [futurebird's](https://sauropods.win/@futurebird/111366068366838326) parable of math, statistics, computer science, and economics to the opening of Tools of Math Construction:

Mathematics has many daughters. Nearly all are beautiful. Physics & Chemistry are dutiful & visit home often. Life science is always away on some exotic research trip, hardly has time to write. Three of the girls live at home: Statistics, Computer Science ... & The Other One.

Statistics spent some time in a sanitarium, no one talks about it. She's doing better now, dotes on mother. Computer Science puts on a suit each day for her Big Important Job. But she still never moved out.

It really seems like only three women live at the house, but there is another.

Economics raids mother's closet (mathematics) and plays dress up stomping around in her most fancy and intimidating notation with none of her precision or grace.

It would be cute, but Economics is pushing 100, feral, and lives in the walls.

Computer Science, the youngest daughter, has some disturbing, mostly repressed memories about playing with "the lady in the wall" when she was little. She shudders to think how she used to look up to the strange and often unkind creature.

But she also still loves her sister maybe more than anyone. Though being quite cold and detached in manner she has no idea how to help her.

Economics doesn't want to be helped. She doesn't want to get "better."

She wants to get WORSE.

* Modify the parable above to more fully incorporate [ShadSterling's addendum](https://mastodon.social/@ShadSterling/111369620558805047)

eventually they’ll figure out that Computer Science has a split personality, one side almost the same as Pure Math, the other side they’ll say is like Applied Math but very disorganized because they won’t admit how much that side is like Economics but focused on building Rube Goldberg machines
