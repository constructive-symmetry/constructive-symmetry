# The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon

You might be asking, why should we care about the Stern-Brocot tree?  Why should we care about this Museum of Fractions?

Well, the Stern-Brocot tree is the Kevin Bacon of elementary arithmetic.[^ramanujan]

Or, as I imagine Paul Erdős might be saying, the Stern-Brocot tree is near the front of God's Textbook of Mathematics.

I am referring to the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.  Kevin Bacon is a famous actor who has appeared on screen in many different productions, including the movie "Apollo 13", in which  Tom Hanks also appears.  So Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon are linked via Apollo 13.

Tom Hanks also appeared in the movies "Who's Got Mail" with Meg Ryan,  and in "Forrest Gump" with Robin Wright.   Thus Meg Ryan and Robin Wright are directly linked to Tom Hanks, and indirectly linked to Kevin Bacon through Tom Hanks.

Meg Ryan is also directly linked to Kevin Bacon, because they both appeared in the movie "In the Cut".  Robin Wright has many such indirect links of length 2 back to Kevin Bacon: for example, Robin Wright was in "Hurlyburly" with Meg Ryan, and in "The Princess Bride" with Wallace Shawn, who appeared in "Starting Over" with Kevin Bacon.

The Oracle of Bacon is a website that tries to track every performer's connections via movies to every other performer.  It scrapes Wikipedia to obtain the data that it uses.  This oracle has no difficulty finding many such links of length two between Robin Wright and Kevin Bacon.  However, according the oracle, Robin Wright has no such direct link to Kevin Bacon at present. [^newyorkiloveyou]

So a performer's "Bacon Number" is the length of a shortest path from that performer back to Kevin Bacon.  Thus Kevin Bacon himself has a Bacon number of zero,  Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, and Wallace Shawn have Bacon numbers of one, and Robin Wright has a Bacon number of two.

Of course, the selection of Kevin Bacon as the "root" of the Six Degrees is arbitrary, we could play the Six Degrees of Robin Wright just as easily.   In this game,  Robin Wright has a Wright Number of zero,  Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, and Wallace Shawn have Wright numbers of one,  and Kevin Bacon has a Wright number of two.   If Kevin Bacon ever appears in a hypothetical future movie that Robin Wright also appears in,  then someday Kevin Bacon could also have a Wright number of one.

Part of the appeal of this game is that each link naturally combines three things together into a little story, which are built up into larger stories, which enhances memory and recall of a corpus of knowledge.  I call this a "Memory Tripod", but this is nothing new.  Greek and Roman philosophies have long recognized the value of various mnemonics and heuristics to enhance the art of memory.  In the study of Rhetoric, there is the Method of Loci, to enhance memory by a physical location, real or imagined. Today, sometimes this is called a memory palace.  These are examples of elaborative encoding.  Variations on elaborative encoding have long been widely appreciated, both in classical scholarship of Grammar and Rhetoric, two legs of the Trivium, and also in the modern departments of English and Creative Writing.

In the context of the Six Degrees, Kevin Bacon is a MacGuffin, a plot device to motivate the game.  At it's best, the game highlights just how connected we are to each other.  The Oracle of Bacon demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of cataloged performers, no matter how obscure, have a Bacon number of six or less.  When you extend the notion of what counts as a "connection" to social situations, you get a social game that, when at its best, should help us understand and appreciate how we are connected to each other.[^cradleofhumankind]

When it comes to choosing a MacGuffin for a Six Degrees game, not all choices are the same.  Not all choices are similar, either, but it wouldn't make much a difference to play the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon or the Six Degrees of Robin Wright, or Wallace Shawn or Tom Hanks or Meg Ryan.  These are all high-profile, well-known performers.

Let's introduce a somewhat arbitrary statistic into our domain of discourse:  let's take each individual performer cataloged in the database, compute the Robin Wright number for each performer, and then average the Wright number among all those hundreds of thousands of performers.  Thus, in the Six Degrees of Robin Wright, the average Wright number is just over 3.  The other performers I've mentioned have a very similar statistic.  The actor with the smallest such statistic is Christopher Lee.  In the Six Degrees of Christopher Lee, the average Lee number is just under 3.  It's quite difficult to simply guess an actor with a high statistic:  even in the Six Degrees of Tommy Wiseau, the average performer has a Wiseau number just under 4.

But we should recognize that both this statistic and the Oracle of Bacon fail to provide any kind of definitive truth.  Rather, they provide a point of discovery.  The discovery is a starting point for lateral cross-checking and internal consistency-checking.   The discovery is a starting point for accounting honestly for the different types of uncertainty and doubt that we should or should not have regarding any conclusions we may wish to draw from the Oracle of Bacon.

These processes of discovery, investigation, lateral cross-checking, internal consistency-checking, and review are necessary for developing meaningful understandings of your domains of study.  And then, as I imagine the philosoper and mathematician William Kingdon Clifford might say, taking our epistemic responsibilities seriously require the wise application of logic, uncertainty, and doubt.  But of course, all the best tools that analytical philosophy and statistics have to offer are useless without starting with a commitment to honesty, and some understanding of all that entails.

# Paul Erdős and God's Textbook of Mathematics

Paul Erdős was a famously eccentric mathematician who co-authored papers with a particularly large number of other people.  Just like Kevin Bacon and Robin Wright are good choices for the roots of a Six Degrees of Hollywood performers who have appeared in a movie together,  Paul Erdős is a good choice for a root of a Six Degrees of mathematicians who have published a paper together.   Much like the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a whimsical social game, the Six Degrees of Paul Erdős is sometimes discussed among mathematicians and other researchers.  For example, my Erdős number is three, through Guo-Qiang Zhang and Rodney Canfield.

Paul Erdős famously used "God's Book of Proofs" as a metaphor for a book containing the clearest, most concise, and most insightful proofs of every theorem.  I imagine God's Textbook of Mathematics as similarly fantastical book that understands exactly where a student is at, and rearranges itself to teach a student whatever the student wants to know in the most expedient fashion possible.  Alternatively, the textbook can suggest a topic to learn about, if the student so desires.

The closest approximation to interacting with God's Textbook that I have personally ever experienced, is talking with Dr. Julian Gevirtz, who is a teacher of mine I once had for Calculus at the Indiana Academy for Science, Mathematics, and the Humanities at Ball State University.  By saying "The Stern Brocot tree is near the front of God's Textbook of Mathematics", I'm stating a conjecture that if a student doesn't already know about the Stern-Brocot tree, then in the overwhelming majority of cases, that would soon change if the student was learning from the Textbook.

For an idea to be near the front of God's Textbook of Mathematics, it must be an ideal root for a Six Degrees game.  It must be a hypercollaborator, and well connected to diverse topics in higher mathematics.  Is the idea equally at home in both continuous _and_ discrete math classes?  Well, that's a hint we might be onto a hypercollaborator.  Does the idea tie together ideas from many different topics in unexpected ways?   That's some of the best evidence that we have indeed found a hypercollaborator!

For an idea to be near the front of God's Textbook of Mathematics, it should ideally be a "power tool" of elementary mathematics in its own right.  And it should invite students to pick up and play with some of the other key power tools of mathematics, especially in Computer Science and Discrete Math, Geometry and Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, and even Calculus and Number Theory. I fully endorse Arthur Benjamin's call to teach Statistics before Calculus.  We would do well to broaden the mathematical curriculum, and encourage our students to go broad before they go deep.  It seems like a wise heuristic to encourage most students to go deeper into Statistics before we encourage them to go deeper into Calculus.

For a idea to be near the front of God's Textbook of Mathematics for most students, it must be plausibly comprehensible to most people interested in learning math, no matter the age, skill, background, or preexisting level of knowledge.  Therefore, the idea must be made concrete, and must not be treated abstractly.  It must be relatively "small", and not depend on complicated ideas and abstractions.  We as teachers must work diligently to apply Ardila's Axioms[^ardilasaxioms] and the philosophy of Fred Rogers to our approach and presentation of the material.

We as teachers must work hard to make the idea as tangible as possible using whatever linguistic metaphors and cultural artifacts that are available to the target audience.  Thus, the Stern-Brocot tree is like a Museum of Fractions, Pascal's Triangle is like a Maze of Counting, and the Symmetry Group of the Square is like a Book of Algebra.

Choosing a metaphor is hard work.  Choose poorly, and the metaphor falls apart quickly, but choose well, and the metaphor has a better chance of being durable enough to construct a memory tripod in the mind of a student.

# An Aggregate Theory of Concrete Mathematics, and learning via a human-computer feedback loop

The Museum of Fractions, the Maze of Counting, and the Book of Algebra are like the aggregates of concrete math.  Computer programming is like portland cement, and the water in this recipe is heuristics.

Heuristics is wisdom that can help you analyze an issue and make more informed judgements about deciding which problem to solve, how to solve that problem, what to study next, and more.  A good heuristic is a wise rule of thumb, but no heuristic is an ironclad principle.  Heuristics can suggest a course of action, but they do not guarantee a solution.  Therefore a heurstic is not a proof, although they certainly lead to proofs.  A heuristic is not a discovery, though heuristics certainly lead to discoveries.

Actually solving a problem yourself, often by writing short computer programs, is like mixing all these things together and pouring this hydrated mixture of concrete math into your mind.  Wait until the math hardens into a new understanding, and come back later and polish your understandings smooth with review and connect your understandings together with synthesis.  Do this enough times, and you will be left with a solid foundation in math, logic, statistics, and problem solving that can support deeper understandings of many things, not only science and mathematics, but also philosophy, astronomy, economics, history, business, accounting, ethics, medicine, and law.

This form of practice is often challenging, but potentially very enjoyable.  Writing short programs is an opportunity par excellence for active learning and inductive chain problem solving.  Project Euler is a internet-based problem set that is well known for promoting this method of learning.

Learning to pour your own concrete mathematics by writing computer programs enables a very powerful learning cadence built on a human-computer feedback loop.  I started typing programs written in BASIC into a Commodore 64 before kindergarden.  In elementary school, I would spend a lot of time in math class thinking about how to write programs, often related to the math that was being discussed.  Then I would go home and write programs in order to better understand what was being talked about in math class.

Playing computers and math off of each other is a methodology that can benefit many people, not only people perceived as smart.  If you put enough effort into this method to make it work, in the long run you can actually learn way more math with less effort.  In a very real sense, you can make yourself smarter.  A small difference in the rate of learning compounded over a decade or two of effort turns into huge differences in the end.  Thus, early exposure is preferred.

I believe that it is likely that this human-computer learning feedback loop can frequently get started in children far younger than we currently expect. In fact, I chose the aggregates I did by asking myself, what would I do if I had an hour to interact with myself as a 5-year old?   What about a day, or a week, possibly spaced over years?  Putting sensible, even austere limits on the scope of interventions under consideration certainly had a way of bringing priorities into sharp focus.

## How to Learn, Part I: a computer-assisted human learning cadence

1.  Write a program yourself
2.  Run your program on a computer
3.  Inspect the output of your program, provided to you by the computer
4.  Compare the output against what you expected to happen
5.  Review your computer program and revise your expectations.
6.  Review your expectations, and revise your computer program.
7.  Your mental models: verify, simplify, generalize, consolidate, and compress them.
8.  Repeat steps as appropriate.

Mix it up:

   * find problems to solve
   * review past programs and solutions
   * make maps of things you might want to work on later
   * explore alternative routes of learning

# Hidden Assumptions and Prerequisites

I have frequently received reactions such as "But Leon, you want to teach *what* to children?  Isn't computer programming a college level topic? Aren't symmetry groups a topic in abstract algebra?  Isn't linear algebra and/or discrete math a prerequisite for abstract algebra?  Concrete Mathematics is a textbook intended for Stanford graduate students, and you want to teach it to babies!"

Well, yes, yes I do, in the simplest and gentlest ways possible. I believe that the Stern-Brocot tree is as fundamental to early childhood math education as the Number Line of John Wallis. I believe Pascal's Triangle is as fundamental as mazes, counting, exploring, and playing games. I believe the Symmetry Group of the Square is as fundamental as the Cartesian coordinates of Rene Descartes.  Knowledge is Power, Francis Bacon!

I do understand why these are common reactions, precisely because my eccentric points of view conflict with commonly held assumptions.  Learning math well often involves exposing hidden assumptions you may not have even been aware you were holding before the lesson began, finding ways to meaningfully modify those assumptions, and exploring the consequences of the new domain of discourse you find yourself in.

Not only is this difficult mental work that can be quite exhausting, it can evoke strong reactions.  We all have some level of emotional attachment to our assumptions, and it's really difficult to be aware of the emotional attachments we have to the assumptions we aren't even aware that we are making.  It's not uncommon for students in this situation to react poorly, and I too have been that student.  On a few occasions, I have even witnessed good students react poorly.  So I understand.  Learning often involves extended periods of discomfort, especially when trying to establish a basic understanding of something new and very different from what you already know for the very first time.

When I was a freshman in high school, on the first day of a mechanical drafting class, I remember my teacher Mr. Davis saying "a lot of people have asked me if geometry should be a prerequisite for drafting.  Well, my opinion is, if you've had geometry then that can help you in drafting, and if you've had drafting that can help you in geometry."  This comforted me, because I would not have geometry until the next year.

That was an idea that definitely stuck with me, and grew into the realization that when it comes to actual concepts, prerequisites are often much more ambiguous than they may seem at first.  Certain orderings of the material will lead to success more often than others, but there are almost always confounding variables that make careful comparisons difficult, even after the fact.  Even so, I would say my elementary education did a perfectly adequate job with sets, so thank you, new math efforts of the 1960s and 70s, your effects on my life is appreciated.[^counting]

In retrospect, I do believe mechanical drawing before geometry was the better choice:  taking drafting first allowed me to develop, practice, and hone my mental models for 3D geometry.  The drafting class focused on developing intuitive understandings, and provided several standard tricks from mechanical drawing that I found quite helpful in the much more proof-oriented (and two-dimensional) geometry class I had the next year.

This is an example of the more general heuristic that, as a rule of thumb, explanations should emphasize intuitive understandings of concrete examples in specific situations, and build towards more rigorous understandings of abstract examples in more general settings.[^exponential]

# The Book of Algebra: The Symmetry Group of the Square

By these criteria, we could do a much better job teaching the Symmetry Group of the Square than we currently do.  Most introductory textbooks on abstract algebra use permutations and/or matrix multiplication to introduce this group.  This seems completely backwards to me.  I would much rather use the symmetry group of the square to introduce permutations, matrix multiplication, semidirect products, modular arithmetic and more!

But let's take this idea further: if we can figure out a way to teach D4 assuming nothing more than an intuition for the geometry of the physical world humanity inhabits, then we could push D4 much further down into the math curriculum.  Perhaps D4 could then be part of somebody's first introduction to the commutative property, cartesian coordinates and other basic concepts in algebra and geometry.  If this is to work, the standard circumlocutions typically used to introduce D4 have to be eliminated.  Years ago, I got very interested in simplifying this very explanation.  To solve that problem I ended up with a carefully designed visual pun.  Let me show you:

In order to understand a symmetry, sometimes you have to break it.  Start with a square piece of paper that is blank on both sides, like a book of algebra that is perfectly square.   Imagine a window over the 12 o'clock position on the book cover.  Draw a square in that window.  We'll call that square "the home square", and when the home square is in the 12 o'clock window, we'll say the piece of paper is in "home position".

Now, open the book.  Starting in home position, imagine the spine of an open book, running up and down vertically through the middle of the paper.  Now, flip the paper right-to-left around that vertical axis, almost like you were turning a page in that open book.  In the now-blank memory window, draw a square with a line down the middle for the spine.  The paper now remembers you opened it like a book.  Close the book by flipping the paper right-to-left around the vertical axis once more,  and double check that we are back in home position.

Next, rotate the paper 90 degrees clockwise, like the home square is an hour hand that now points to 3 o'clock.  The 12 o'clock window is now blank, so in the memory window we'll draw a square with a curved arrow pointing 90 degrees clockwise.  The paper now remembers how it got here, that you turned it 90 degrees clockwise away from home position.   Turn the paper back 90 degrees counterclockwise, and verify you are back in home position.

Repeat this process for the other three flips:  starting in home position, open the book like a legal-style notepad,  and flip the paper up-to-down around the horizontal axis.  Draw a memory in the window, a square with a horizontal line through it,  and then close the notepad using one smooth flip to get back to home position.  Then do the same for the two diagonal flips, and then for the other two rotations.   After you are done, you should have 8 depictions, one for each symmetry of the square, four on each side of the paper.

Our paper, a Book of Algebra, is now a mechanical calculator for the symmetry group of the square.  It remembers all of its positions, and you can read its memory by looking at the window over the 12 o'clock position.  We can add two symmetries together by starting at home position, then performing each action on the paper square.  The paper then tells us what the net effect of those two actions put together is, by reading the memory in window.  At this point, if a student can figure out the visual pun behind each glyph and perform that action on the calculator as a whole, then the student can compute the arithmetic of the symmetry group of the square, with the help of this mechanical number line.

# Using symmetry to teach elementary mathematics

In order to appreciate a symmetry, sometimes it really helps to break it.  Consider the commutativity laws for integers, fractions, and decimal numbers.   Many students struggle to understand why commutativity is not self-evident,  and D4 is a simple example that helps break through that mental block.  In the arithmetic of D4, x + y is not always equal to y + x,  and thus addition on D4 is not commutative.  Thus commutativity is not a mere tautology.

addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, exponentiation on Z, Q, R, C (and quotient algebras thereof)


Many students struggle to distinguish associativity and commutativity as fundamentally different things, because the examples they are taught are both associative and commutative.  D4 is among the simplest examples of a group that is associative but not commutative.  Of course, there are examples of binary operators that are commutative but not associative, and neither commutative nor associative, and all four quadrants have ideas well worth knowing.  D4 and boolean logic are two of the simplest topics that together cover all four quadrants.  Boolean logic is an essential substrate for computer programming, digital logic engineering, mathematical reasoning, analytical philosophy, and statistics.

In order to appreciate a symmetry, sometimes you have to understand it in terms of another.   Many students struggle to connect the commutatitivy of multiplication on integers, fractions, and decimal numbers to the fact that rotation of a rectangle doesn't change it's area,  and struggle to connect associativity to the fact that the rotation of a brick doesn't change it's volume.  This approach to teaching D4 should help here, too, as this provides a simple concrete mental model for the Euclidean isometries these explanations depend upon.

At some point, we should learn how to compute the arithmetic of D4 without the help of our mechanical number line.  Imagine a car on a circular track.  There are 4 stops around the track, at the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 9 o'clock positions.  In a single instruction,  you can tell the car to drive forward any number of stops, and then after the car stops, the instruction specifies whether the car turns around to change direction for the next instruction, or if instead the car continues on the same direction around the track.

Arithmetic on this representation computes the combined effect of two of these instructions.  This provides simple, concrete example of a semidirect product and a modular arithmetic, and illustrates that the dihedral introduces a hystersis of orientation.  I would probably start with this implementation.

The second implementation of D4 is based on matrix multiplication.  I cannot imagine a simpler or more ideal setting for gently introducing and motivating matrices and quickly tying their arithmetic to a memory tripod than the symmetry group of the square!   The first step is understanding D4's action on the cartesian coordinate grid Z⨯Z.   The second step is learning to implement D4's action on Z^2 by multiplying a 2⨯2 matrix with a 2⨯1 vector.   Finally, the third step is learning implement arithmetic on D4 as a full 2⨯2 matrix multiplication.  The determinant of these matrices is ±1, which corresponds to the orientation.  Linear algebra and geometric interpretations thereof certainly are topics that are easy to underappreciate, and this pedagogical route emphasizes this connection from the very start.


# The Stern-Brocot tree as a Rosetta Stone of computer science and mathematics

In order to appreciate what symmetry is, you need to see it in a variety of circumstances and start looking for it elsewhere.  Consider the twisted symmetry of reciprocals on the Stern-Brocot tree: if you flip the Stern-Brocot tree left-to-right, you flip the fractions up-to-down.  This symmetry seems much more concrete than commutativity and associativity, yet more abstract than the symmetry group of the square.  This twisted symmetry is closely related to computing the resistance of parallel resistors,  the capacitance of series capacitors, and the inductance of parallel inductors, things that are commonly measured by an electrical engineer's LCR meter or multimeter.

Understanding the mediant inequality, or why the mediant of two positive fractions is always between those fractions, is a good application of three concepts: the cartesian coordinate grid N^2, the parallelogram rule of vector addition, and the concept of slope.  Though I had some introduction to cartesian coordinates in elementary school, the other concepts were introduced in Algebra I, Geometry, and Linear Algebra.  There seems to be significant motivation for introducing these concepts earlier in a stripped-down and simplified form.

Understanding why the mediant inequality implies that the Stern-Brocot tree is a binary search tree, is an example of using a loop invariant in computer science.   Loop invariants are abstract symmetries computer programmers use to reason, usually informally, about loops inside their programs.  If the reasoning is formal, the reasoning might use induction over either pure functions, or Hoare logic if imperative reasoning is needed.  Another formalization would be a coinductive proof over the Stern-Brocot coalgebra, drawing on ideas in category theory that were independently invented at least three times in modal logic, theories of automata and concurrency, and non-wellfounded set theory.

If you conduct a binary search on the Stern-Brocot search tree for an irrational number such as pi or the square root of two,  topics that naturally fall out include rational approximation, convergence, and limits.  These topics are often studied for the first time in Calculus 2 and Numerical Analysis, yet all have elementary discussions when largely restricted to the Stern-Brocot tree.  My only reservation about Arthur Benjamin's wonderful slogan to _teach statistics before calculus_, is that I fear some people might take that too literally.  I desire an elementary curriculum that samples from many tables at the grand banquet that is modern mathematics, and calculus is no exception.

Units of Measurements, Dimensional Analysis, and Types are three closely related concepts that also seem like good things to front-load in the elementary curriculum, especially because they inform problem-solving heuristics.  My first serious introduction to Dimensional Analysis was in high school Chemistry.  There were a few hints of types and units of measurements and dimensions in elementary school, but we never carried the units of measurement all the way through the problem,  and never explicitly talked about dimensional analysis.

Ideally, Dimensions and Types would be nicely integrated into a programming environments that the students use.  I'm not fully aware of an existing implementation that wraps up everything I want with a bow on top, but Haskell, Dr. Racket, and the Axiom computer algebra system are some excellent starting points for working with types.  Dependently-typed programming languages may show us the way, some day, but I digress.

If you apply worst-case analysis to the Stern-Brocot tree,  topics that naturally fall out are the Fibonacci Sequence, the Golden Ratio, and asymptotic analysis.  This line of thought eventually leads to theorems of Diophantine rational approximation such as Dirichlet's Approximation Theorem and Hurwitz's Theorem.

If you apply run-length encoding to the paths down into the Stern-Brocot tree,  topics that naturally fall out include integer multiplication as repeated addition, integer division as repeated subtraction, continued fractions, efficient multiplication and division algorithms,  and early discussions of the computational complexity of algorithms.   Integer division is a particularly important trailhead in math, because there's approximately six different philosophies about how to apply integer division and interpret it's results,  each trail of thought leading to mountains of mathematics.

I find it very interesting that we can start with addition and the Stern-Brocot tree and fairly quickly use it to motivate multiplication and division, both simplified algorithms that are conceptually important, first for learning and then later for reasoning,  and efficient algorithms that are practical for actual computation.  These are major goals of the traditional K-6 mathematical curriculum, thus there seems to be strong motivations to explain the Stern-Brocot tree like I'm five.

The Stern-Brocot tree is a Rosetta Stone of math and computer science.  If you feed an idea into the Stern-Brocot tree, in return it loves to provide new understanding.  I've  given an high-level overview of some of the connections to computer science, arithmetic, calculus, numerical analysis, and electrical engineering.  Up next, I'm going to emphasize the bridges that the Stern-Brocot tree provides between computer science, algebra, geometry, modern physics, and the interactions between different domains of discourse.

# The Stern-Brocot representation, Georg Cantor, and Non-Euclidean Geometry

I am going to sketch out one possible course of study from my aggregate theory of concrete mathematics to non-Euclidean geometry, specifically, the hyperbolic plane of Nikolai Lobachevsky and János Bolyai, which is an important conceptual stepping stone towards Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  Of course, to personally understand something about hyperbolic geometry yourself would require you to put forth a concerted effort over an extended period of time.  Some of my more advanced listeners will have done this already.  I hope this entertaining and valuable for all audiences, and there is value in having references for possible later exploration.

Euclid's common notion number five says that the whole is greater than a part.  Or, as you might intuitively reason, "if Alice has everything that Bob has, and Alice has something that Bob does not have, then Alice has more than Bob", which is a perfectly logical argument.

Consider the following:  all positive integers are rational, and between every pair of adjacent integers, there exist an infinite number of non-integer rational numbers.   So you might appeal to your intution,  or even to Euclid's intuition as memorialized in his common notion number five,  to conclude that the rationals are more numerous than the integers.

Now, conduct a left-to-right breadth-first traversal of the Stern-Brocot tree, marking every room with it's room number, an algorithm known as breadth-first numbering.  It is a fact that we get an exact one-to-one correspondence between the positive integers and the positive rationals.  This 1-1 correspondence is an abstract symmetry of sets, sometimes also called a bijection, a permutation, or an isomorphism of sets.  Thus the rationals are somehow more than, yet equal in number to, the integers.  This contradicts what Euclid himself deemed to be common sense, circa 300 BC. Today we recognize that integers are equinumerous to the rationals, despite the fact that the integers are also a proper subset of the rationals.  This was first recognized by Georg Cantor, circa 1874.  Infinity is weird.  It will get weirder.

It's poetic justice that Euclid himself gave us the guidebook to the museum of fractions, which is a key part of the solution that allows us to compute this 1-1 isomorphism efficiently!  The Euclidean algorithm takes any fraction as input, and as output provides a path to the unique room on the Stern-Brocot tree that contains that fraction.  This path is known as the Stern-Brocot representation, and we can think of it like a string in computer programming, a finite string consisting of solely of 'L's and 'R's.  We can use the Stern-Brocot representation of a fraction to efficiently compute the room number of that fraction, and vice-versa: just change the 'L's to 0 and the 'R's to 1,  and put another '1' in front, and interpret the result as a binary number.

Every room in the Stern-Brocot tree has a boundary matrix.  The boundary fractions of a room on the Stern-Brocot tree exactly correspond to a 2x2 matrix with nonnegative integer entries, and with determinant equal to one.  The converse is also true, a result in linear Diophantine equations.  Moving left on the Stern-Brocot tree corresponds to multiplying by the boundary matrix of one half's room.  Moving right on the Stern-Brocot tree corresponds to multiplying by the boundary matrix of two's room.  The monoid generated by these left and right matrices corresponds exactly to the Stern-Brocot tree.  This monoid is free, because in this garden of forking paths, the paths deeper into the museum never ever come back together.  I call this "the Stern-Brocot free monoid SL(2,N)", a subset of the 2x2 matrices with nonnegative integer entries.

Any free monoid is conceptually very similar to the string type in computer programming.   In the case of the Stern-Brocot free monoid, there's an isomorphism between the matrices of SL(2,N) and finite strings consisting solely of L and R.   This isomorphism's 1-1 correspondence can be efficiently computed in both directions.[^sternbrocotrepresentation]  The individual characters 'L' and 'R' exactly correspond to the left and right matrices, and matrix multiplication exactly corresponds to string concatination.  So not only is this correspondence an isomorphism of sets, it's also an isomorphism of monoids, which means this symmetry preserves something beyond quantity.

You might think of it as if there were two different physical layouts of SL(2,N) in computer memory.  Because this is an isomorphism of monoids, it does not matter which layout we use; it's guaranteed to work exactly the same either way.  As long as we match matrix multiplications to the matrix layout and match string concatination to the string layout, we can freely convert between the two physical layouts and the two operators however we see fit, and get equivalent results.

Given a boundary matrix in Stern-Brocot free monoid SL(2,N), multiplying by the column vector (1 1) on the right gets you a label on the Stern-Brocot tree, and multiplying by the row vector (1 1) on the left gets you a label on the Calkin-Wilf tree.  You can move between these two trees by taking the anti-diagonal transpose of a matrix in SL(2,N).

If you consider the group of 2⨯2 matrices generated by the union of SL(2,N) and the Symmetry Group of the Square D_4, you get the general linear group GL(2,Z),  which is all the 2x2 matrices with integer elements and determinant ±1.[^automorphisms]

In fact, every 2⨯2 matrix in GL(2,Z) can be written in exactly four different ways as the product of an element in D4, then an element in SL(2,N), and finally D4 again,  with the exception that elements of D4 can themselves be written in eight different ways.  In a sense, GL(2,Z) is sixteen copies of SL(2,N) interacting in complicated ways, much like the signed integers Z are are two copies of the natural numbers N interacting in much a simpler way.

We can zoom in on the most interesting complication in this interaction by taking a look at the modular group PSL(2,Z), which is an example of a Fuchsian group because it can be interpreted as a discrete subgroup of the isometries of the hyperbolic plane.[^modularforms]  Hyperbolic geometry was the first example of a non-Euclidean geometry recognized as such by Gauss, Lobachevsky, and Bolyai.

# Judging the applicability of assumptions to differing domains of discourse.

Not only did Euclid give us the guidebook, the Museum of Fractions can lead us with reasonable efficiency to multiple different domains of discourse in which some of Euclid's assumptions fail to hold.  Sometimes an assumption is an excellent fit to a given context.  Sometimes an assumption is clearly rubbish, in a given context.  Often the suitability of an assumption for a context is far more ambiguous.

For most practical purposes, the geometry of the patch of universe we inhabit is Euclidean.  Structural engineering and mechanical engineering are domains of discourse in which all of Euclid's common notions and postulates have perfectly reasonable interpretations, and neither of our "counterexamples" make much sense, at least not directly.

But once we fully own the fact that these apparent contradictions are _not counterexamples_,  but a change in assumptions with an attendant change in the domain of discourse, then we can start to appreciate that abstract geometry can be useful for artists and engineers.  One famous example is M.C. Escher's tilings of the hyperbolic plane.   Although the final artifact may be constrained to 2 or 3 euclidean dimensions, abstract geometries are very powerful tools that can be used to arrive at and/or analyze the result.  Crystallography in physics and chemistry is another such example.  And then there are domains of discourse in which non-Euclidean geometry is not optional, due to Einstein's Theory of Relativity.

During the space flight of one of our GPS navigation satellites, we have to take into account that its orbit around the Earth is just barely non-Euclidean.[^galilean]  If we fail to account for this in our mathematical models of the flight path,  the error between our model and observed reality would slowly accumulate over time.  For many satellites this hasn't been a big deal, but navigation satellites need extremely accurate models of their positions in space and time relative to the Earth's surface to work at all.  Removing the Theory of Relativity from the mathematical models and algorithms that are in use today for satellite navigation, would cause our navigation systems to stop working in pretty short order.  Thus, everybody who has used their phone to navigate, has helped to laterally cross-check Einstein's Theory of Relativity.

In neither case does Georg Cantor's isomorphisms of infinite sets make any direct sense,  because an isomorphism of sets isn't a geometric isometry without first adequately explaining the connection.  And if we explain the connection, we have elaborated the isomorphism into an isometry.  However, when we shift the context to computer science and the theories of information and communication, then geometric interpretations are not required, and Cantor's isomorphisms of infinite sets are directly relevant to these domains of discourse without requiring further elaboration.

It requires wisdom, domain expertise, and experience to make good judgements about whether or not an assumption is a reasonable fit to a specific situation in the "real world".  That's where analytical philosophy bleeds into epistemology and the human experience.  Answering these questions are firmly beyond the scope of pure mathematics, although the toolbox of mathematics can be used to help inform these judgements.

In the study of pure logic, assumptions aren't really "true" or "false",  assumptions are statements that are assumed to be true in some bounded context.  Logic helps us track our assumptions precisely, so we know what assumptions are necessary for a logical argument to apply to a domain of discourse.  Statistics gives us further tools we can use to investigate the plausibilities of an assumption in a context, and statistical tools help us track our uncertainties and doubts more precisely.  Statistics is important because both false certainties and false doubts can have extremely negative long-term consequences.

# Hidden Assumptions, Non-Euclidean Geometry, and Einstein's Relativity

We all have emotional attachments to our assumptions, so dealing with hidden assumptions that we aren't even aware that we are making, can be especially difficult.  Non-Euclidean geometry is a good example of just how difficult this can be.  Euclid's postulates of geometry went unchallenged for over two thousand years.  People widely assumed Euclid had found base mathematical truth, a Platonic ideal of the universe itself.  In fact, this interpretation was explicitly part of the curriculum taught by Jesuit colleges for centuries.

Giovanni Saccheri was a Jesuit priest and mathematician who published many theorems about hyperbolic geometry in 1733, nearly 100 years before Lobachevsky and Bolyai.  Except, Saccheri did not believe he was studying hyperbolic geometry, rather, he believed he was disproving its existence, via a logical technique known as an indirect proof.  In the terminology of our parable of the Oracle of Bacon, Saccheri was checking the internal consistency of hyperbolic geometry,  expecting to find it inconsistent because hyperbolic geometry does not obviously pass any lateral cross-checks.  This is a particularly notable failure of the heuristic that things that fail cross-checks also fail consistency-checks.

This appears to have been a source of confusion, anxiety, and fear for Saccheri, as he waited until near of the end of his life to publish this work, and then he felt compelled to write that "the hypothesis of hyperbolic geometry is absolutely false; because it is repugnant to the nature of straight lines."  Saccheri may have never seriously considered the possibility that he might be proving theorems of an alternative geometry that is fully consistent with its own internal logic, even if it does not comport with everyday experience.[^jesuitmathematics]

Carl Fredrich Gauss discovered hyperbolic geometry several decades before Lobachevsky and Bolyai, but didn't publish it.  It's possible, perhaps even probable, that Gauss was concerned about risking his reputation attempting to challenge widely-held assumptions that seemed unassailable at the time, preferring to hide his results behind the obscurity of multidimensional calculus and keeping quiet about some of the implications that were obvious to him.

However, once Lobachevsky and Bolyai published their discoveries of hyperbolic geometry in 1829 and 1832, it wasn't even 100 years until we had the first evidence that the underlying geometry of the universe is in fact non-Euclidean.  James Clerk Maxwell had difficulty reconciling the laws of Newtonian physics with the laws of electromagnetism, proposing the luminiferous ether as solution in 1861.  Bernhard Reimann and William Kingdon Clifford anticipated the possibility that the universe might not be Euclidean, but both died before they had the opportunity to learn the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment, which failed to detect the presence of Maxwell's luminiferous ether in 1887.  Albert Einstein did the hard work of gathering these and every other data point he could find, and used them as starting points to inform his very best guess about what a non-Euclidean universe might actually look like.  Einstein published his Theory of Special Relativity in 1905, Einstein's wonderful year, or annus mirabilis.

In 1904 Hermann Minkowski, a former professor of Einstein's, gave a lecture about the Stern-Brocot representation to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Heidelberg, and in 1907, Minkowski published the first mathematical model that conformed to Einstein's postulates of Special Relativity.  Einstein used Minkowski's model to help develop his Theory of General Relativity, which Einstein published in 1915.  Then, in 1919 and 1922 Sir Arthur Eddington and W.W. Campbell performed the very first tests that suggested that Einstein might be correct,  by very carefully measuring the positions of stars that appeared around the sun during a solar eclipse.

Ever since, many tens of thousands of scientists have helped conduct much more precise experiments in a multitude of contexts, none of which have cleary contradicted Einstein's General Theory of Relativity in any repeatable fashion.  Relativity and non-Euclidean geometry certainly seem necessary to explain our observations about the universe, because they pass a large number of highly non-obvious lateral cross-checks.

Emmy Noether published Noether's Theorem in 1918, which allows physicists to explain symmetries in the laws of physics in terms of the conservation laws of physics, and vice-versa.  Shortly after Emmy Noether's early death in 1935, Albert Einstein wrote to the New York Times saying that her ideas are among the most important new ideas in mathematics of his day.

Noether's work continues to be a mainstay of mathematical physics and theoretical physics to this very day, and a crowning achievement of the body of work that is modern algebra to which many, many mathematicians have contributed.  Physicists are currently probing whether the charge-parity-time symmetry, or CPT-symmetry, is a fundamental symmetry of our universe, or whether there might be a detectable violation of CPT-symmetry we don't know about yet.

Today, physicists are keenly aware that Einstein's Relativity cannot explain everything we have observed about the universe, but pretty much every honest physicist believes that a more complete theory of the universe would have to explain why Einstein's Theory of General Relativity appears to be so very approximately correct in so many different contexts.

The story of Relativity is a story of discovery.  Einstein's publication of the Theory of Relativity wasn't treated as truth, instead it was used as the starting point for the hard work of lateral cross-checking, internal consistency-checking, and honestly accounting for uncertainty and doubt.

Each of these activities can be enormously difficult and time-consuming tasks in and of themselves, in the story of non-Euclidean geometry and the Theory of Relativity, people like Sacherri, Michelson, Morley, Einstein and Eddington devoted significant parts of their lives to one of these subtasks, work that continues to this very day.  You can get better at each subtask.  Mathematicians, computer scientists, logicians, statisticians, and philosophers have developed many tools and heuristics to help.

# an infinite wilderness of mathematical possibility

Despite this long digression about assumptions, domains of discourse, non-Euclidean geometry and Einstein's Relativity, the value of the Stern-Brocot tree to the math curriculum has barely been scratched, let alone exhausted!  But I'm exhausted, so if you make it this far, good job!

I consider this roughly the first half of a 10,000 foot overview of my aggregate theory of concrete mathematics, the first half of a preface of sorts, if you will. But the second half is not yet ready, and organizing large thoughts into an attractive presentation takes a lot of time and energy, and this video is already a lot to digest.

This video is a simulacrum of mathematical truth.  This video is not itself definitive mathematical truth. Think of this video as a trail guide you can follow. You cannot appreciate the trails until you hike them yourselves.  Treat this video like a starting point for investigation, not a definitive source of truth.  Its okay if you never make it all the way to the end of this trailguide, and never forget that there is no end to the trails in an unending and infinite wilderness of mathematical possibility.

In the meantime I've posted "Tools of Math Construction: an Aggregate Theory of Concrete Mathematics" as a study guide about how to be reasonable, in many different senses of the word "Reasonable". It is an apology for the Indiana Pi Bill, and an Apology for Science, Faith, Reason, and Humanity.  I offer it as my pandemic love letter to the State of California, the United States, and All Human Kind.

# a philosophy for a broken world

Finally, many of us feel as if the world is pretty broken, and well, it kinda is.  I don't know how we might once again listen better to that which makes humans peculiar, and therefore that which is inside of us all, something I personally call "the inner light", along with many other Friends.

People care about things that are not scientific, like religion, philosophy, mathematics,[^computerscience] and other people.  Sometimes people believe that something must be scientific in order to be true, or to be honest, or to have meaning, or to have utility.  Sometimes people believe that something must be measured to have value.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  People have value beyond measure!

Things can be honest and truthful despite not being literally true in the scientific sense.  Performance art and creative writing and ideas in mathematics don't have to be well-connected to be interesting.  Philosophy and religion don't have to be scientific to have meaning.  And most importantly, people don't have to be measured to have value!

Some people are deeply invested into being measured, and so they want to apply the trappings of science to the measurements of people and ideas.  Concrete examples include taking the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, Erdős numbers, or measures of "centrality" too seriously,  or using my rhetorical metaphor of "ideas near the front of God's Textbook" to dismiss legitimate mathematical ideas.

Some people apply the trappings of science to nonsense, so that they may feel important, or so that they may make money selling nonsense.  Both are mistakes.  You are important!  But selling nonsense is wrong, and science is real, even if there are things that are pretending to be scientific that aren't.

Other people, feeling insecure about the unscientific thing they value, misapply the notions of science to the thing they feel insecure about in an attempt to hide or cover for their insecurity.  Just because something is unscientific, does not imply that it has no meaning or no purpose or no utility!  Sometimes, it's ok to be unscientific!

We need to fully own these facts, and to feel them in our hearts.  I feel that the misapplications of "science" and "reason" to faulty measurements and suspect contexts has a lot of explanatory power regarding the things that are wrong in our culture today.[^scientists]

And yet, some things very much do need to be measured and scientific.  When it comes to airplanes, trains, and automobiles, we need our transportation infrastructure to be measured and scientific.  When it comes to doctors and dentists, we need every core physical medical intervention to be measured and scientific.  When it comes to the rules of a fair and honest democracy, we need input from people who have thought carefully and generously about moral philosophy and who have conducted deep investigations into math, statistics, game theory, social choice theory, and election science!  When it comes to the thermodynamic and material basis of our economy,  we need to be measured, scientific, with honesty and justice towards each other, and optimized for the long now!

I hope I am wise enough to make good judgements about what domains of discourse must be scientific, what domains must not be scientific, what domains are more subtle, and how those different domains interact.  But I certainly don't feel like I have an sastifactory philosophical theory that explains what those differences are, except to appeal to the fruit of the spirit, and to exhort all of you to take your epistemic responsibilities seriously!

Our widespread dishonesty, our lack of care, and the wholesale destruction of social trust that we have experienced makes me sad. I know it is a difficult time for a lot of you, too. This pandemic will become less acute over time, but in the mean time, we need to stand up and show up for the kind of world we want to live in afterwards.

Let us all strive to confront dishonesty with integrity and compassion, whether in ourselves or others.  Let us all understand that energy spent hating other people is ultimately wasted power.  Let us all strive avoid willful blindness, while also finding a way to feel at peace about ourselves and our place in this world.  We all belong, we all deserve a place here in this cradle of humanity.  And let us all strive to replace fear and false certainty with logic, uncertainty, and doubt!

## How to Learn Part II: Review

1. No math problem is ever truly exhausted, and no computer program is ever truly finished.
   Review is often worthwhile.  Repeat steps.  Take this seriously.

2. Don't fixate on one problem for too long.  Go broad, not deep.  Return to the problem later, especially after you've learned new things.

3. Work on groups of related problems at once.  Try to keep your search local, not scattershot.

4. Heuristics are wise rules of thumb, not ironclad principles.  Break these rules as needed.

Mix it up:

   * Have at least one uncommon tool in your toolbox of solutions
   * Have at least one uncommon question on your list of unsolved problems

## How to Learn Part III: Alternative routes of learning

1. Talk to other people interested in talking about math
2. Watch videos and lectures about mathematics
3. Study with groups of other people
4. Read about mathematics: books, magazines, wikis, blog posts, etc.
5. Pretend like you are going to teach something, and prepare an explanation
6. Verbalize your explanation to a rubber duck
7. Find a willing listener, and verbalize your explanation to another person
8. Try inventing your own problems
9. Try inventing your own problem sets
10. Try putting two ideas together in weirdest ways you can imagine
11. Experiment with your own learning heuristics, and review how they worked


## How to Learn Part IV: Make a Map

1. Be on the lookout (BOLO) for:
     * problems and problem sets, even if you don't plan on working on them.
     * algorithms and heuristics, even if you don't plan on studying them.
     * theories and languages, even if you don't plan on using them.
     * whatever else you decide to be on the lookout for
     * referential knowledge is still valuable,  see the Knowledge Illusion

2. When you get a match on a BOLO,  investigate:
      * what is the domain of discourse?
      * what assumptions to they make?
      * what priorities do they value?
      * what do they ignore?
      * what are the larger contexts?

3. Try to hold your assumptions loosely. Take being wrong as an opportunity to revise your map.

4. Incorrect solutions are can be wrong in an interesting way.  "Proofs" with nonobvious flaws are particularly important to pay attention to.  Zeno's Paradoxes are a classic example.

5. Sometimes incorrect solutions can be made correct with a nonobvious change in assumptions.

6. Observation #5 is quite independent of #4.  All four combinations are possible.

# Footnotes

[^ramanujan]:
    Of course, associating Kevin Bacon with the Stern-Brocot tree is a totally arbitrary MacGuffin I'm using to tap into an existing cultural metaphor.  A historically meaningful metaphor would be remembering Srinivasa Ramanujan (1920) and Āryabhaṭa (circa 499 C.E.)  See my footnote on the video "A tour of the Stern-Brocot tree, a Museum of Fractions" for a more detailed historical overview.

    How many different ways are there to assign six performers to the six ingredients in my aggregate theory of mathematics, so that performers and ideas are put into an exact one-to-one correspondence?

    Rephrasing the above question in a more abstract and advanced way:  how many elements are there in the symmetric group of permutations S_6, the number of distinct bijections on a set of six elements?  It turns out that S_6 is the only finite permutation group that has an outer automorphism.  Understanding what that means and why that is, turns out to be very interesting.

[^newyorkiloveyou]:
    Both Kevin Bacon and Robin Wright appeared in the film "New York I Love You", as it was screened at the 2008 Toronto Film Festival.  This film was an anthology of 14 short films, with Kevin Bacon and Robin Wright appearing in different shorts.  However, before it was released, several of the short films were cut, and the short that Kevin Bacon appeared in was among them.   The Oracle of Bacon does not recognize that Kevin Bacon is connected to "New York I Love You".  So, there is an argument that Kevin Bacon already has a Wright number of one, if we go by film festival screenings.

    On the other hand, Kevin Bacon's scene in "Starting Over", in which Wallace Shawn appeared, was also cut from the final release.  Kevin Bacon never actually appeared in the movie, although his name does appear in the credits, and this movie is the only movie that the Oracle of Bacon recognizes as a direct connection between Kevin Bacon and Wallace Shawn.  So there's an argument that this connection is kind of weak, and maybe Kevin Bacon shouldn't have a Shawn number of one.

    However, both Robin Wright and Wallace Shawn's Bacon numbers are certainly 2 or less.  For example, Robin Wright and Wallace Shawn were in the "Princess Bride" with Christopher Guest, who was in "A Few Good Men" with Kevin Bacon.

    There is no definitively "correct" answer to what Kevin Bacon's Wright number and Shawn number is, because that depends on the assumptions we are making about what counts as a "connection".  Should credits for appearances in scenes cut from release count?  What about uncredited appearances?  Should film festival screenings count?  Should film anthologies really be a connection between performers that appeared in different shorts?  If anthologies don't count, should any film "connect" two performers that don't share any screen time together?   What if the performers never even met on set?

    When playing Six Degrees as a social game, connections should of course be "allowed", though qualitative assessments of the connections can be interesting.  However, when it comes to creating, using, and supervising computer-based golems such as the Oracle of Bacon, its vitally important to discuss, understand and even be pendantic about what assumptions are being made.  Then you need wisdom and domain knowledge to assess whether those assumptions are a reasonable fit for a given context or application.

    Even if a database has clear rubrics for making careful, precise judgments, and the database is carefully curated, the real world is going to produce an edge case once in a while, and the answer may not be clear cut.  Sometime these edge cases can be a sign that the question itself needs to be revised, or eliminated.

    Every database of sufficient size is going to contain errors, and all rubrics are useless without curation.  What are the consequences of those errors?   We must be careful not to interpret the contents of a computer database, or the output of a fancy algorithm, as providing any kind of definitive truth about the world.  While many databases and algorithms are useful, nearly all of them have signficant limitations.

    I consider Cathy O'Neil's book "Weapons of Math Destruction" to be required reading to be an responsible and informed citizen or knowledge worker in today's world.  As William Kingdon Clifford just might say, the modern world would do well to learn to be less distracted by the blinkenlights, and take greater responsibility for the things we think, the things we do, and the things we say.

[^cradleofhumankind]:
    While I was writing this paragraph, I couldn't help but recall the song "Cradle of Humankind" by Flogging Molly.  Perhaps you would enjoy it.

[^ardilasaxioms]:
    Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

    Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

    Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

    Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

    These statements should not sound revolutionary, but considering the current practices of the mathematical society, they are a pressing call to action.

[^exponential]:
    Many people have advocated for the "concrete examples before abstract principles" heuristic to teaching mathematics.  Doron Zeilberger's Opinion 65 regarding Gelfand's principle has played a particularly strong role in my thinking about math pedagogy.  Daniel Friedman and Kent Dybvig have both themselves contributed strongly to my thinking.

    One likely exception to this rule of thumb is teaching exponentials and logarithms.  Young children certainly can get started with exponents and logarithms in terms of the integer powers of ten and the integer powers of two.  These are sufficient to introduce the terminology and give concrete examples of the basic algebraic properties these functions exhibit.

    Once it's time to extend the exponential and the logarithm to real numbers, I strongly suspect it's better to treat these operators abstractly, via their algebraic laws.  I suspect it's better to not get too caught up in how to rigorously define what's going on, or how to actually compute these functions.   At that point it's time to use the algebraic laws of exponentials and logarithms, play with a slide rule, and use a calculator or library routine, and call it a day.

    Or at least, that's what I believe in the context of the contemporary math curriculum.  I suspect that much like programming language design, curriculum design has choices with very non-linear consequences to contemplate.  I would say this assessment is very much worth reviewing, if someday the Stern-Brocot tree and computer programming becomes a mature part of the elementary curriculum.  After all, there are ways to calculate general exponentials using the Stern-Brocot tree that are conceptually simple, even if they are not efficient.  You certainly would not want to execute them by hand.

    Of course the unit circle and Euler's identity, and thus exponentials and complex arithmetic, are very important to trigonometry.  The same can be said of matrix arithmetic and a touch of linear algebra.

    Instead of postponing these ideas until later, I feel it's better to introduce matrix arithmetic and slide rules before trigonometry, and to introduce Euler's formula near the beginning of trigonometry, so that these ideas can be used when appropriate to simplify and accelerate the learning process.

[^counting]:
    The coverage of counting and combinatorics in my pre-calculus curriculum, on the other hand, left much to be desired.  Also, pretty much all of the history of combinatorics and counting is something I delved into myself, in the process of writing this video.  The standard curriculum often does a poor job regarding the history of mathematics in general, but the history of combinatorics is all but ignored.  But I was delighted when Emily Miller sent me a link to Victoria Hanna's song about the Sefer Yetzirah, which you might also enjoy.

    Although my elementary curriculum touched on combinatorics onced a while,  I almost feel like the often cursory coverage of counting, factorial, permutations, and combinations in Algebra 2 and pre-calc almost does more harm than good, as illustrated by the Bat, Buffalo, and Eagle problem I invented to highlight the issue:

    Say you have three US American quarters.  There are two sides to each quarter:  heads, which for the purposes of this problem are mutually indistinguishable among the three quarters, and then the tail sides consist of a bat, a buffalo, and an eagle.  How many different strings of three symbols can you make with those three quarters?

    This is not a particularly advanced counting problem, but it's got a complication that trips up many students who have only had the cursory (and inadequate) exposure to combinatorics typical of Algebra II and pre-calc classes in the United States circa the turn of the millenium.  But worse, many students apply what they think they know from those classes, attempt to solve the problem, and don't have a good enough feel for combinatorics to suspect that they are wrong,  and don't do enough critical examination of the answer to realize that they are wrong.

    I admit, I found combinatorics frustrating and yet exhilirating for years for this exact reason.  In combinatorics, not only is it easy to make mistakes, it can be difficult to understand that you made a mistake, let alone understand what that mistake is.  I overcame this hurdle via years of practice and a solid basis in discrete math, logic, set theory, and a touch of abstract algebra.   Still, I do think we can do a much better job than the approaches my classmates and I were taught.

    This is undoubtably a complicated issue, and I'm not entirely satisfied with my own very incomplete ideas of how to introduce combinatorics.  But at the very least, Algebra II and Pre-Calc should better highlight the complications and pitfalls of the counting techniques they teach.

    But there is a very wise heuristic here:  you should not fully trust a concept or technique or model until you start to understand its limitations, until you start to understand the situations in which it doesn't apply.

[^sternbrocotrepresentation]:  Note that while the conversion between matrices in SL(2,N) and a string-based Stern-Brocot representation can be efficiently computed,  the conversion itself is not necessarily efficient, because when converting from SL(2,N) to the Stern-Brocot string,  the output string can be exponentially bigger than the input.  For example, consider the SL(2,N) representation of say, a trillion, or 10^12.   While the matrix can be represented in less than 32 bytes,  the string would be one terabit, or 125 gigabytes long, as big as two and a half blu-ray movies.  This issue can be fixed by run-length encoding the Stern-Brocot representation,  essentially upgrading this representation to continued fractions.

[^automorphisms]:  The matrices GL(2,Z) exactly represent automorphisms of the additive group Z^2.  These automorphisms are the most abstract and general notion of group symmetry available that preserves both the cartesian coordinate grid and the arithmetic of pointwise addition on integer vectors.  These automorphisms essentially tell us all the possible ways to extend Z^2 using a semidirect product and still be left with a group.  The semidirect product of Z^2 and GL(2,Z) can then be used to introduce affine transformations, homogenous coordinates, and projective geometry.

[^modularforms]: The modular group PSL(2,Z) is also notable because of it's relationship to modular forms and the j-invariant, a complex holomorphic function first studied by Felix Klein.  These ideas are intimately related to elliptic curves.  Understanding this relationship more precisely is the Langlands program, one of the major research programs of contemporary modern mathematics.  Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem involved constructing and proving more precise understandings of a tiny part of this relationship.

[^galilean]:
    It's a bit more precisely accurate to say that a satellite's flight path is non-Galilean than it is to say it's non-Euclidean, but both statements are correct, and this is a rather non-trivial detail that's largely extraneous to the main argument being made.

    The Galilean group of Galilean transformations over a Euclidean spacetime is central to Newtonian mechanics, while the Lorentz and Poincaré groups of Lorentz transformations and translations of a Minkowski spacetime is central to the study of Relativity.

    We humans perceive the ground we stand on to be perfectly still, even though the Earth is moving through space while spinning on an axis.  Our perception of terra firma was behind the ancient Aristotalian justifications that the Earth was the unmoving center of the universe.  The Galilean transformation provides a justification of why this apparent contradiction from a common-sense logic that was well-regarded during the European renaissance, might not be a contradiction in fact.

    Galileo's (1564-1642) early work on the moons of Jupiter, which implied that Aristotelian physics is incorrect, was ultimately well received by Christopher Clavius (1538-1612).  Clavius was a Jesuit professor in the Collegio Romano, and the the most prominent astronomer and mathematician of the Catholic Church.  Clavius was well regarded at the time for his work on the Gregorian calendar reform, and notable even today for his tireless efforts in improving math education during the Renaissance.

    Galileo's later work involving a Copernican model of the solar system lead to two inquests by the Catholic Church, the first of which (1616) restricted his research and the second of which (1633) placed Galileo under house arrest for the remainder of his life, during which he wrote some of his most influential work.

[^jesuitmathematics]:
    The anxiety that a mathematician would naturally feel while contemplating the possibility of an alternative to well-regarded theory is by no means the only plausible interpretation of Giovanni Sacherri's disclaimer.  Another is that Sacherri set aside his personal opinion on the matter, and felt such a disclaimer was necessitated by his elite position as a Jesuit priest.

    Any such anxiety about the possibility of hyperbolic geometry would clearly be amplified by Sacherri's priesthood, because in the context of Jesuit education of the early 18th century, contradicting Euclid was akin to contradicting God.  The reason goes back to the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, which saw the creation of the Society of Jesus, or Jesuits, as an order of the Roman Catholic Church.

    Christopher Clavius was an early member of the Collegio Romano and was responsible for making mathematics a respected part of the Jesuit educational curriculum.  Clavius himself set the first versions of exactly what math would and would not be taught at Jesuit institutions around the world.  As part of this project, Clavius used Euclidean geometry's apparent claim to "absolute truth", as an example of the "absolute truth" of (Roman Catholic) theology.

    The educational efforts of the Society of Jesus proved very popular and effective over the next few centuries, and Jesuit colleges became something the order was best known for.  Jesuit education spread this particular conflation between Euclid and theology widely around the world, and likely contributed to Carl Fredrich Gauss's reluctance to talk publicly about non-Euclidean geometry.  Carl Fredrich Gauss himself had a reputation as a land surveyor to uphold and defend.

    If Giovanni Sacherri considered the possibility of non-Euclidean geometry, then it seems rather plausible, perhaps even likely, that he never allowed himself to contemplate it deeply due to his institutional allegiance.

    For an introduction to Sacherri's political context, see Amir Alexander's "Infinitesimal: How a Dangereous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World".  This book focuses on the conflicts that the Jesuits initially had with the early developments of calculus.   However, the book doesn't get as far as non-Euclidean geometry or Sacherri himself, as it focuses on the transition from the late Renaissance to the early Enlightmentment, from roughly 1500 to 1700.

[^computerscience]:
    As I see computer science as a topic in mathematics, somewhat confusingly, I would include computer science in the list of things that are not necessarily scientific.

    Now, there are other opinions that I respect, and even agree with to varying degrees, advocating making the practice of mathematics more concrete, more experimental, and even more "scientific".  For example, Herbert Wilf's classic paper "Mathematics: An Experimental Science",  or some of Doron Zeilberger's opinions.

    However I've seen a recurrent problem among mathematicians, computer scientists, and economists, who (quite correctly, in my opinion) see the rules of mathematics as quite arbitrary.  But a sizable subset of these overgeneralize the freedom that a mathematician has to choose their own rules, and apply that to scientific contexts.

    So, while the practice of mathematics certainly can be informed by the practice of science, and vice versa, I'm reluctant to call mathematics a "science" because we need to have a linguistic way to delineate the difference.  Clearly, science and mathematics are deeply related to each other!

    The thoughts inside our heads cannot be constrained by empirical realities. Mathematics must not be constrained by scientific realities.

    Conversely, neither the thoughts inside our heads nor the artifacts of our cultures have any causal effect on the rules of the universe.

    At it's best, mathematics is uncannily and peculiarly effective at understanding the rules of the universe, and some of the behaviors that can entail.

    Scientific contexts require a mindset that demand a more careful and critical empirical inspection of the assumptions required for a mathematical model to be ethical, desirable, and otherwise suitable for task.

[^scientists]:  Although the misapplication of the trappings of science to faulty measurements and suspect contexts is indeed a real problem, a problem that I suspect is a significant driver of strife in our society, I would emphasize that it's often not professional scientists who are misapplying the notions of science.  (Though, clearly, sometimes it is.)
