This release is very incomplete, but also very late.

I've misplaced a few files that I meant to include with this release.

I've paid very little attention to proper formatting; there is much to be done.

These issues I intend to rectify sooner than later.

There are also outlines of sections I hope to someday write for "Tools of Math Construction".  Those might take quite some time
