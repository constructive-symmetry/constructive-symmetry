# Pascal's Triangle is a Maze of Counting

Pascal's Triangle is an idea in math.  It's like a Maze of Counting you can visit in your mind.   Imagine an eight-by-eight game board for playing chess and checkers,  and we are going to rotate it 45 degrees, so it looks like a diamond.  And imagine it extends infinitely far down and left, and infinitely far down andright,  so that it tiles a quadrant of the plane.   The square at the top of the game board is the front room of the maze.  That room contains the number one, because the empty path is the one and only path from the front room to itself.   There are two doors in the front room, down and to the left, and down and to the right,  leading to other rooms represented by squares on the game board.  

This museum only counts paths that move down and left, and down and right.  Moving upwards,  or across the corner of a room, can be a perfectly good "path", but is not among the paths that Pascal's Triangle is counting.   

Going down to the second row in the museum, the room to the left contains a one,  because going down and left is the one and only path from the front room.  At any point, going down and to the right would require eventually making a move up and to the left, which isn't a path that Pascal's Triangle is counting.    The room to the right also contains a one, and to justify this we need only to interchange "left" and "right" in the argument we just made.  

Let's look at the middle room in the third row of the museum.   It contains a two, because starting in the front room,  we can go left and then right, or right and then left.  In this garden of forking paths, the paths downward into the museum are constantly coming back together.   In every room in this museum, as we go down, we can go either left and then right, or right and then left, and always end up in the same new room either way.   





Every room has two doors,  down and left, and down and right,  leading to other rooms represented by squares on the game board.  Pick any room,  the question is,  how many paths are there from the front room to the room you picked, if the paths we are counting are only allowed to move down and left and down and right?   The answer to that question is displayed in the room you picked.

So if you pick the front room, the empty path is the one and only path from the front room to itself.  We can't leave the room and come back to it without moving up and left or up and right,  which is a path that is not counted by Pascal's Triangle.  So the front room contains the number one.

Going down a level in the museum,  the room to the left contains the number "one",  because going left is the one and only path from the front room to this room.  If we go right, then it's impossible to reach the room in question without moving up and to the left,  which is a path that is not counted by Pascal's Triangle.   The room to the right also contains the number "one", we only need to interchange "left" and "right" in the previous justification, for the left room.

Now, let's consider the middle room on the third row.   

So, pick any room.  The question is,  if you are only allowed to move down and left,  and down and right,  


The front room of the Museum is the square at the top of the game board.   Every room has two doors, down and left, and down and right.   In this garden of forking paths,  the paths downwards into the Museum of Counting are constantly coming back togther.   If we first go down and left,  and then go down and to the right,  we always end up in the same room as if we had went vice-versa:  first down and right, and then down and left.   Apply these rules consistently everywhere,  and extend the game board infinitely downwards in both directions,  so that it covers a quarter of the plane,  also known as a "quadrant".

So, pick any room.  The question is, if you are only allowed to move down and left, and down and right, how many paths are there from the front room to the room you picked?   The answer to that question is contained within the room you picked.  






starting from the front room, how many different paths are there to any given room if you can only move down and to the left, and down and to the right?    Every room contains the answer to this very question.

The 


  Every room has a door down and to the left,  and another door down and to the right.   The paths downward into the Museum of Counting always come back together:  if we go down and to the left,  and then down and to the right,  we always end up in the same room as if we had gone vice-versa:  down and to the right, and then down and to the left.  So if you apply these rules consistently everywhere,  and assume the rooms along the edges are all distinct,   you end up extending the game board infinitely in two directions,  so that it covers a quadrant of the plane.
