In the notes to commit 5b981f5300f8eab18cfb73cc7c083fae8bb6214f, I
noted what seemed like a contradiction in these two sources:

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2433055/group-isomorphic-to-its-automorphism-group

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1008972/the-automorphism-group-of-the-infinite-dihedral-group

In previous versions of the notes associated with this project, I'd tacitly assumed that Dih(Z) ≅ Aut(Dih(Z)), based on the first source.  But I didn't (and still don't quite) correctly understand the automorphisms of Dih(Z), which turn out to be a little tricker than I thought.

The latter is clearly correct regarding Inn(Dih(Z)), and is clearly correct
regarding the existence of an outer automorphism, and has the sheen of
correctness regarding Out(Dih(Z)).

    Since
          Aut(Dih(Z)) ≅ Inn(Dih(Z)) ⋊ Z_2
      and     Dih(Z)  ≅ Inn(Dih(Z))

I assumed that this implied that Dih(Z) cannot be isomorphic to Aut(Dih(Z)),
but since we are dealing with an infinite group, it is concievably possible that
Inn(Dih(Z)) ≅ Inn(Dih(Z)) ⋊ Z_2

I realized this after I looked somewhat more carefully at "A Note on Groups with
Just-Infinite Automorphism Groups", by Francesco de Giovanni and Diana
Imperatore, noticed that it acknowledged that Dih(Z) had outer automorphisms,
and concluded that I was likely incorrect about the paper being wrong
because it was much too basic a mistake for somebody who specializes in Group
Theory to make.

On the other hand, the following page is definitely incorrect: Dih(Z_6) cannot
be complete because it has a non-trivial center.  The same is true of all
dihedral groups of even degree. (or of order evenly divisible by four)
