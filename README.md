This respository explicates _an Aggregate Theory of Concrete Mathematics_. It is a philosophy of math and computer science education with practical aspirations on the elementary (K-6) curriculum, and beyond.

In addition to these materials, I highly recommend taking a look at the [Brown University Bootstrap Project](https://bootstrapworld.org/), Chris D Smith's [Code World](https://code.world), as well as [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and [Arduino](https://arduino.cc).

Currently, this repository contains several different media assets.

The **praxis tracks** are intended to be a part of an actual course of study.  I hope that each project helps you develop a deeper understanding of some important little nugget of knowledge, but math is not a spectator sport.  To really understand something in math, you also have to play with the idea for a while.

Every folder is is intended to become a video, and to be accessible to as broad an audience as possible, especially young children.  None of these projects are quite ready to go, at the moment.  They are still under construction.

**A001** is [_A tour of the Stern-Brocot tree, a Museum of Fractions_](./A001_A_Tour_of_the_Museum_of_Fractions/A001_A_Tour_of_the_Stern-Brocot_tree__a_Museum_of_Fractions.md). This is an introduction to the Stern-Brocot tree. Currently, I have a script with detailed historical notes, a recording of my voice as an [audio track](A001_A_Tour_of_the_Museum_of_Fractions/A001_A_Tour_of_the_Stern-Brocot_tree__a_Museum_of_Fractions.flac), some [closed captions](A001_A_Tour_of_the_Museum_of_Fractions/A001_A_Tour_of_the_Stern-Brocot_tree__a_Museum_of_Fractions__CloseCaptions.txt), and an attempt at an [opening SVG graphic](./A001_A_Tour_of_the_Museum_of_Fractions/Museum_of_Fractions.svg).

I don't have video available yet to go along with the audio, and the historical notes should include more references to follow up on specific claims.

**A002** is [_The Euclidean Algorithm as a guidebook to the Museum: rebuilding fractions using the Stern-Brocot Tree_](./A002_The_Guidebook_to_the_Museum_of_Fractions/A002_The_Euclidean_Algorithm_as_the_Guidebook.md). This introduces connection between the Euclidean Algorithm and the Stern-Brocot tree.  We start with the Pi Day approximation 3.14.  Then we use the Euclidean Algorithm to first round 3.14 ‚âà 22/7, and then to finish reducing to least terms, 3.14 = 157/50. This Pi Day approximation happens to be a shadowed semi-convergent of ùúã.  It is overshadowed by the previous convergent, 22/7, which is closer to ùúã despite the fact that the denominator 7 is much smaller than the denominator 50. However, as a semi-convergent, 3.14 is never overshadowed by any rational approximation of ùúã that isn't also a convergent of ùúã.

The script feels workable and nearly complete. There are extensive footnotes.

**B001** is an introduction to Pascal's Triangle. This project is the least developed of the four. There's a very incomplete script in there.

**C001** is an introduction to the concept of symmetry in a geometric context, focusing on the Euclidean isometries exhibited by the letters `H`, `O`, `M`, and `E`.

**C002** is an introduction to the Symmetry Group of the Square.  _Kevin Bacon and the Stern-Brocot Tree_ happened to provide a very good start on a [script for this video](./C002_The_Square_Book_of_Algebra/C002_The_Symmetry_Group_of_the_Square__a_Book_of_Algebra.md).  I have a mechanical calculator and some worksheets ready to go, but unfortunately I've misplaced those files for the time being.  Those files will be located, or recreated.  In the meantime, if you want to get a taste for what the calculator for the symmetry group of the square looks like,  I've included a [pdf calculator for the symmetry group of the hexagon](./C002_The_Square_Book_of_Algebra/d6.pdf) instead.  Print it out front-to-back, and then cut out the two largest hexagons.

The **theory track** is more like a series of travel brochures: these projects are trying to convince you to go learn something for yourself.  In contrast to the praxis tracks, nobody is expected to really directly understand much of anything from watching or reading these projects for the first time. Instead they are intended to provide referential knowledge, suggestions, ideas, hints, and clues about what to study next.

**T001** is [_Kevin Bacon and the Stern-Brocot Tree: a Sermon on Rational Approximation_](./T001_Kevin_Bacon_and_the_Stern-Brocot_Tree/a_Sermon_on_Rational_Approximation.md), an overview of symmetry and rational approximation, both in the sense of John von Neumann and Herbert Simon, as well as Diophantus of Alexandria.  It spends most of its time on an outline of an extended course of study that starts with the Stern-Brocot Tree and the Symmetry Group of the Square, and ends with the Stern-Brocot free monoid SL(2,N), and the modular group PSL(2,Z).  This connects nicely with the books "Indra's Pearls, the Vision of Felix Klein", "Introduction to Experimental Mathematics", and "Concrete Mathematics", which appear in the companion study guide "Tools of Math Construction".

This project is intended to become a video.  I feel like the script is more-or-less complete. Work on the video has yet to begin.

**T002** is [_Tools of Math Construction: an Aggregate Theory of Concrete Mathematics_](./T002_Tools_of_Math_Construction/An_Aggregate_Theory_of_Concrete_Mathematics.md), the associated study guide.  It is quite long, it is semi-autobiographical, it is far from complete, but I hope it will be interesting and useful in its present form.  There's also some [handwritten notes on the modular group](./T002_Tools_of_Math_Construction/notes-on-modular-group.pdf) if you are sufficiently curious. A big thank you to [Existential Comics](http://existentialcomics.com) and [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/) for the comics liberally infused into the study guide.

The **theory track** attempts to explain why the aggregate theory is the way it is. It attempts to provide a preface and 10,000 foot overview of the larger theory. It is aimed at a "prosumer" mathematical audience. I try to keep things as simple and accessible possible, but it's also moves quickly. You aren't expected to immediately understand very much of what I mention.

Rather, the theory track is intended to create referential knowledge in the minds of students who are so interested and motivated.  These references are intended to provide hints, clues, and suggestions about places to go next.  The theory track is also intended to help teachers navigate the larger aggregate theory.

In preparation for the theory track,  I recommend being able to understand what a metaphor is, because I'm going to introduce a lot of metaphor that you won't be familiar with at first. 

The metaphor-heavy nature of these projects likely means that most young children are likely to have great difficulty understanding them. Rather, these projects are more directly intended for their parents, teachers, and caretakers.  

However, once a child starts to appreciate metaphor, I hope that they can derive direct benefit from the theory track.  Of course, the child may be likely to understand less than an adult, but an adult is also more likely to feeling like they don't understand, and and more likely to allow their discomfort from prevent them from trying.

It's okay to feel discouraged or intimidated when trying to learn something new, but it's important to try again anyway. This stuff is difficult to learn for the first time! Neither failure nor the fear of failure should prevent you from trying to learn.

Every mathematician struggled to understand things.  Many mathematicians develop a taste for the struggle, striving for the mental rush that comes from a new understanding, that understanding you suspect might just be a few more failed attempts away.
