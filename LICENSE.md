This repository includes certain copyrightable assets not owned by Iterative Systems LLC, to which these claims may not directly apply. Prominent examples include a great many selections of visual artwork from [Existential Comics](https://existentialcomics.com/) interspersed throughout the "Tools of Math Construction" study guide. The English legalese of the Creative Commons 4.0 International Licenses are the intellectual property of the [Creative Commons Corporation](https://creativecommons.org/). ["The Kingdom of God is Within You"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kingdom_of_God_Is_Within_You) by [Leo Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy) is now public domain, as are all of Tolstoy's writings and some of the translations from the original Russian.

In all cases, a good-faith effort has been made to ensure these inclusions are compatible with the corresponding Creative Commons license and other relevant intellectual property laws, including Copyright, Patent, and Trademark laws. Iterative Systems LLC is always supremely interested in remedying any mistakes made on this count.

In all cases, Iterative Systems LLC prefers to be compatible with the wishes and desires of the original author and the current intellectual property owners. If any authors or owners of an included copyright asset have a good-faith desire to revise their wishes, then Iterative Systems LLC is very much interested in trying to accomodate these situations as reasonably as possible as they may arise.

However, Iterative Systems LLC is unable to guarantee any outcome based on these intentions. An example of concerns that might prevent a desired outcome, especially in cases involving a change of heart, are concerns regarding resource-sensitivity on the part of Iterative Systems LLC and/or the general public. For a discussion of resource-sensitivity, see the essay ["Why String Diagrams?" on the Graphical Linear Algebra website](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2017/04/24/why-string-diagrams/).
