  I cannot imagine a simpler or more ideal setting for gently introducing and motivating matrices and quickly tying their arithmetic to a memory tripod than the symmetry group of the square!   The first step is understanding D4's action on the cartesian coordinate grid Z⨯Z.   The second step is learning to implement D4's action on Z^2 by multiplying a 2⨯2 matrix with a 2⨯1 vector.   Finally, the third step is learning implement arithmetic on D4 as a full 2⨯2 matrix multiplication.  The determinant of these matrices is ±1, which corresponds to the orientation.  Linear algebra and geometric interpretations thereof certainly are topics that are easy to underappreciate, and this pedagogical route emphasizes this connection from the very start.
