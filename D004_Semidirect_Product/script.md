Imagine a car on a circular track.  There are 4 stops around the track, at the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 9 o'clock positions.  In a single instruction,  you can tell the car to drive forward any number of stops, and then after the car stops, the instruction specifies whether the car turns around to change direction for the next instruction, or if instead the car continues on the same direction around the track.

Arithmetic on this representation computes the combined effect of two of these instructions.  This provides simple, concrete example of a semidirect product and a modular arithmetic, and illustrates that the dihedral introduces a hystersis of orientation.
